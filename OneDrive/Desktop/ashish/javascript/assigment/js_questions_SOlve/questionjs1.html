    <div>Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Vehicle' with properties for make, model, and year.
        Include a method to display vehicle details. Create a subclass called 'Car' that inherits from the 'Vehicle'
        class and includes an additional property for the number of doors. Override the display method to include the
        number of doors.</div>
